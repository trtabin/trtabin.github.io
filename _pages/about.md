I’m a Bangladeshi electrical engineer and programmer passionate about embedded systems and machine learning. During my professional career, I have had the opportunity to work on projects ranging from embedded software architecture design to developing algorithms for sensor node communication. Among my skills, I highlight my ability to develop and debug firmware for different microcontrollers, microprocessors, and SoCs of various architectures. Currently, I’m working on a software development project for a wearable device that aims to integrate an Al algorithm into an edge device. My research interests include the development of low-complexity, power-efficient machine learning solutions for wearable devices, energy-efficient signal processing, and edge computing.

# Work Experience 

### Engineer I, R&D Product Development Planning
Samsung Electronics [ 05/2024 – Current ] 

1. Focused on improving system layer knowledge within the team to support the development of application layer code.
2. Developed and maintained FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) updates and flash memory management, optimizing system
updates across devices.
3. Integrated application and system layers code to improve communication, performance, and reliability.
4. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to debug and optimize device drivers for seamless operation.
5. Develop POC (Proof of Concepts) for adding new features in the Samsung’s existing products.

### Embedded Hardware Engineer
CredoSense Inc. (Ltd). [ 08/2022 – 04/2024 ] 

1. Updated the existing firmware of IoT-Gateway to reduce 30% power consumption by improving sleep mode and using a separate low-power coprocessor and also improved the overall performance of the device.
2. Designed and developed the IoT-Core platform to easily authenticate Iot-Gateway devices and collect data from the devices.
3. For long-range wired communication developed and implemented a higher layer CAN protocol, which is used in IoT-Gateway to collect data from various sensor-nodes.
