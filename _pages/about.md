Hey! Thanks for stopping by my website. I’m Alicia, a graduate research assistant at the University of Missouri – Columbia. I pursued my master’s as a Fulbright Scholar and now, I’m working towards my PhD in Computer Science. I have been working in the “Virtualization, Multimedia and Networking Lab” (VIMAN Lab) since Jan 2020, where I constantly make the best of any opportunity to further advance my skills, and build collaborators with other universities, faculty and students.
