        <h4>Development of an Sensor Network Communication Protocol [Jan.2024 – Apr. 2024]</h4>
        <p>
            • Developed an application-layer protocol that enables automatic registration and integration of new sensor nodes for simplified network deployment over the CAN bus. <br>
            • Designed a scalable architecture to support a growing number of sensor. <br>
            • Implemented a packet reordering mechanism to address out-of-sequence delivery. <br>
            • Achieved a 40% increase in data acquisition speed compared to the previous manually-configured system by streamlining the node integration process. <br>

        <h4>Comparative Study on Feature Selection for Heart Disease Prediction [Dec.2021 – Nov. 2022]</h4>
        <p>
            • Different feature selection techniques such as filter, wrapper, and embedded methods are used for heart disease prediction. <br>
            • Compare the performance of feature selection techniques with different classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning algorithms, in the context of heart disease prediction. <br>
